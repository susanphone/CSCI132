#  3.6 Cloning a Data Structure
    Want to make a copy of something
        Address Book - make a copy
            Flavor 1) for you, update copy, want both to update
            
            Flavor 2) for someone else, want to update copy and original independently
    
    int[] data = {2,3,5,7};
    int[] backup = data;

    backup not a new array pointer to same object as data

## Clone Method
    backup = data.clone();
    
        shallow copy - fields of new object refer to fields of original object
            if you update one you update the other
            not 100% disjoint

        deep copy- make an entirely new object and new pointer
            if you change one, you will not change the other
#### Quiz alert: shallow vs deep copies
