# 3.1 Arrays
## Arrays vs linked lists
### Arrays
    Fast access to element at a given index
        array 10th element 
            arr[10]
        add remove elements
            slow in arrays
                have to copy the array

### Linked LIsts
    Slow access to given index
        must iterate
        add remove is fast

    example: Using arrays book scoreboard
        high score for video game

        class GameEntry(Streing name, int score)

        class ScoreBoard(int # entries, game entries[]board)

            ScoreBoard
            Brad    7
            Alice   4               Add Entry
            Bob     3
            null    null

                if(#entries<board.length || new score > board(n-1).getScore)
                ^-- does it fit?                        ^--- Are you high score?
            
            new GameEntry = Sarah   2
                Sarah gets added to board
            
            new GameEntry = Tina 10
                Sarah gets kick out and move everyone down

                    ScoreBoard
                    Tina    10
                    Brad    7
                    Alice   4
                    Bob     3

    Arrays start at zero
        int[]arr = new int[3]
            0   1   2
    Initially array contains null, until you fill your array
