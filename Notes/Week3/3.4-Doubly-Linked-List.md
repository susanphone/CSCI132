# 3.4 Doubly Linked List
    Have a previous method

    Double linked list:
        Data
            next()
            previous()
    header
    [][][]-->[][][]--->next> [][][] --->next> [][][] ---> Trailer[][][]
                ^previous<---   ^previous<---
            
    Have guard (sentinels) nodes on the ends
        head => node.previous() = null
        tail => node.next() = null
    Easy to insert new node
        need to update next and previous pointers
