# Algorithm Analysis
    What is an algorithm?
        step by step procedure for performing some task in finite time
    Want algorithms to run fast
        nothing unneccesary
    Want to take up as little space as possible in memory
        Disreguard hardware and software and language
    "roll up sleves"
        do math

    In java can time how long an algorithm takes
        System.CountTimeMillis()
    Mantra
        "Can we do better"
    
    Example: Search for some element in element in sort array
    A={2   3   5   7   11}
    x = 4
    algo1 
                -> another
                 loop
        for (i< n; n = length.a):
        if a[i] = 4
            found it
            break
        else:
            i= i++
            if i = n
                return (not here)
        Graph runtime as n increases
            graph has linear growth, as n increases runtime increases

    Algo 2 - Binary Search
        A ={2   3   5   7   11}
        x = 4
        lowerbound = 0
        upperbound = n-1

        while (x not found)
            mid = low + (upper-low)/2
        if A mid < x
                lowerbound = mid + 1
        if A mid > x        
                upperbound = mid - 1
        else:
            found it
            break
                    cut size of array in half
                        5>4 ---> [2,3]
### How many times can we itierate
    p = number of steps

    1 = n/2^p       solve for p

    log_2(2^p) = log_2(n)
        p = log_2(n)

    Graph of Algo two
        Graph of log

### Binary search is faster than linear search
    
    What arewe counting?
        everything
            arithmetic
            assignment pf variable
            comparing things
            returning something
            calling method
