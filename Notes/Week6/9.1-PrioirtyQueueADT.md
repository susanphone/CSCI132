# 9.1 Priority Queues ADT
    Queue- Line FIFO
## Priority Queues has Key/Value Pairs
(key,value) - entry
    key- how important is the task
    value- what to store
## Priorty Queue ADT
    insert(k,v) - get in line
    min() - return but not remove entry with minimum key
    removeMin() - return and remove entry minimum key
    size()
    isEmpty()
### Examples of Priority Queues in Action:
    Air Traffic Control
        Queue is line up to land
        minimum key/value able to cut in line
    Operating System
        tasks to be computed on CPU
        task(n) - cool down CPU
            assign min key/value
    How to decide top priority interesting question
### Example on pg 361
    entry-(key,value)
    key = integers
    value = characters
    Method          return value        Queue
    insert(5,A)                          {5,A}
    insert(9,B)                          {(5,A), (9,B)}
    insert(3,C)                          {(3,C), (5,A), (9,B)}
    min()               (3,C)            {(3,C), (5,A), (9,B)}
    removeMin()         (3,C)            {(5,A), (9,B)}
