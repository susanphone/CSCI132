# 4.4 Justification
### Proofs are a large part of computer science

## Operations and Runtime in Java
            loose ends
    array.length uses constant time
        java stores
    array[3] = 7 access an element in constant time
        no need to iterate
    Finding maximum in an unsorted array 
        big O(n) n-length
    Sorting an array 
        big O(nlog(n))

## Proofs
    Justify algorithm gives correct output
        induction technique
    
    Prove Big O(g(n)) og Big Omega(g(n))
    
    Prove a while loop terminates

#### Will see these ideas in CSCI246, CSCI432

    example:
        proof of correctness
            arrayFind(int[] array, int val)
                is val in our array
            iterate over entire array
            use loop invariant to prove this
                1) initially true
                2) If L_i-1 is true
                    iterate then L_i is true
                3) Final L_k is true
### Proof types
    induction
    contrapositive
    contradiction
