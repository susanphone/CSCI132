# 4.3 Asymptotic Analysis
## Big Oh
    Bounded above
    f(n) is  O(g(n)) if there exists constants c and n_0 such that f(n) =< C * g(n) for all n >= n_0
        two functions
        find two constants 
            c and n_0
    Examples:
        polynomials
    
    Warning:
        constant is so large algorithm would not finish

## Big Omega
    Bounded below
    f(n) is Omega(g(n)) if f(n) >= C * g(n) for all n >= n_0

    Fact: log(n) < n for n > 1
    n^2 is Omega (n log(n))
