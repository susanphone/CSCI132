# Recursion
    any function that calls itself

    Example:
        Recursive Fibonacci
            f(0) = 1    f(1) = 1
                f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)  for n > 1
                1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...
                0  1  2  3  4  5  6
            Want to return the nth Fibonacci number given n
                F = 8
                    Recursive Fib (n)
                        if (n=1 or n=0)
                            return 1
                        else
                            return Recursive fib(n-1) + Recursive fib(n-2)
            IT Calls itself!!!!
        If T = number of function calls
            T(n) = T(n-1)+T(n-2)
            ==T(n-2) + T(n-2)
            = 2T(n-2)           4T(n-4)         8T(n-6)
            subtract 2   n/2 times
### Recursive functions can be fast
    Binary Search + sorted array
        2   3   5   7   11  13
        2   3   5 | 7   11  13
                    7 | 11  13
                    [7]
            Three calls half the initial size => Fast
        Runtime O(log(n))
### Searching file systems is nice application of Recursion
    Folders are the branches
    Files are the leaves
