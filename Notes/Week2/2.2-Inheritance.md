# 2.2 Inheritance
    Hierarchical relation on classes
        -have parent child relationship
        child "is a"
    Example:
        Auto
            make: String
            model: String           <----- Auto Class
            price: double
            start()
            stop()              We might want to AUGMENT
            move()
## Augment - Add new fields/ new methods
## Specialize - update some methods
                        Auto
        /                 |                 \
      car               truck             motorcycle
    /    \             /     \              /       \
  SUV   Sedan       Semi    Pickup       Hog        Sport

        Truck "is a" auto
        Pickup "is a" Truck
    Look at Pickup subclass:
        Pickup already has:
            make
            model
            price
        Want to add
            Towing: int
            Carry: int      <------- adding new fields
            Tow()
            Carry()         <------- new methods
                ^---------  Only apply to pickups
### In Java
        class pickup entends Auto {
            //Additional fields
                towing = t;
                carry = c;
            // Constructor
                truck(make, model, price, towing, carry)
                Super(make, model, price)
                    towing = t
                    carry = c;
            // New methods
                tow()
                carry()
        }        
    calls constructor in the parent class (Auto)
## Polymorphism:
    many shapes
    In java they inherit different things
        Auto auto1: new pickup(info);
        Auto auto2: new sedan(info);
    Many forms based on which child class is called.
