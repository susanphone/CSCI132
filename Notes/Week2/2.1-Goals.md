# Goals, Priniciples and Patterns

## Goals:
    Robust - code can handle unexpected inpputs
        Example:
            Price is negative
        Very important - life critical at times,
    
    Adaptability - ourside conditions may change
        Example:
            code that inly works on Windows95
    Portability - run on different hardware
        Example:
            iPhone, android

## Abstraction:
    Break code into small parts
        only making small changes
### Quiz Alert------^

## ADT (Abstract Data Types)
    Specifies what type of data is stored
    and how it is stored

## Encapsulation:
    Don't reveal inner workings
    Dont want people relying on technical asspects of our code (we might chang code)

## Modularity:
    Divide components into separate units
    easier to test and debug

## Design Patterns:
    Proven strategies to solve problems of a certain type
