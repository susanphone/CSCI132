# 1.8 Packages
    prebuilt code:
        input java.util.Scanner
            ==> can use Scanner
        import java.lang.math
            abs|x|
### Don't import packages that you don't need.
### Don't use packages on the labs and projects unless told it's okay. Ask.

# 1.9 Software Development
    Design - What should the classes be? How do they interact?
    
    Coding- What algorithms to use?

    Testing & Debugging - Make sure code works

### Design: What classes to make
    Resposibility - what needs to be done? How is a class going to do a task?

    Independence - Don't want internals of a class to depend of each other.

    Behaviors - Input/output is compatible with other classes.

    UML diagrams - organizational diagram

### Coding: organize thoughts
    Psuedo Code - code read by human
        language independent

### Testing & Debugging:
    perform experiments to see if code is working
    
    check edge cases
        Example:
            array length 0?
            three points in a line(coveneer points)
    
    degenerate case that causes enexpencted problems

#### Startegy: Put in print statements
        System.out.println(x);
            do stuff
    Most remove these  :(

    Debuggers exist
