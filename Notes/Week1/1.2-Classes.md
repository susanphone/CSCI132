# Classes 1.2
## Base Types
    int integer
    boolean t/f
    char    character
    double  decimal
### Problem:
    Want to work with an object that is not a base type
## Ex: Points in a plane
                |
                |
          o     |       o
                |
________________|_____________              Points aren't in Java
                |
                |
### Idea: Make a point class!

    Main{
        Points P1 = new points(5.0, -1.3)
        P1.print();
    }
#### Point Class
    public class points{
    //Fields
        private double x = 0;
        private double y = 0;
    //Constructor
        public points(double first, double second)
        {x = first
        y=second}
    //Methods
        Public void print()         return nothing and no input
    }
    System.out.print(
        "(" + this.x + "," + this.y + ")")
    
    Output:
        (5.0, -1.3)

## Classes are objects in object oriented programming
    Payoff: Recycle the points class on any project.
