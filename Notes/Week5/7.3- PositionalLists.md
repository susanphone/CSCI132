# 7.3-Positional Lists
    Recall: Store things in a linear sequence
        Arrays + Lists
        ArrayLists - once we are full alocate more memory
    List - want to access the ith item O(n) time
    Want ADT to refer to elements in a sequence
### Example
    Line of people
        assign each person a position
        If use indicies, constantly will need to update :(
        so assign a variable that does not change when we manipulate other elements
    Have getElement()
### Positional List ADT
    same as list, each node has extra position variable
                                    updates
    first()                     addFirst(e)
    last()                      addLast(e)
    before(p)                   addBefore(p,e)
    after(p)                    addAfter(p,e)
    isEmpty()                   set(p,e)
    size()                      remove(p)
            Look at Table on pg 274
    All O(1) Fast! :)
### Implementation
    use DoublyLinked List in Book
    Use Array
        but addFirst, addBeforem addAfter are all O(n) :(
