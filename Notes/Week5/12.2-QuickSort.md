# 12.2 Quick Sort
    Sortings
        -insertions sort    O(n^2)
        -merge sort         O(nlogn)
        - bubble sort       O(n^2)
    Quick Sort - Divide and conquer
### Example:
        [4  3   2   7   1]
            select x in A
            x=4
            Split array into three subsequences
                L- less than x                  3   2   1
                E- equal to x                   4
                G- greater than x               7
            LEG is our divider
    Conquer- recursive calls
            x = 3
                2   1       3
            x=2 
                1   2
    Combine- glue sorted array together
            glue 1 and 2
            glue 3 to 1 2
            glue 4 to 1 2 3
            glue 7 to the end
        now we have the sorted array    [1  2   3   4   7]
### Picture of Quick sort
                 [A]
            /     |     \
            L     E     G
            \     |     /
            Glue back together
### Runtime?
    -divide - Linear    O(n)
        have to iterate over entire array
    Think of tree
        leaves of the nodes     O(n*h(height))
    Problem:
        height could be n-1
                O(n*n-1) = O(n^2) :(
        use probability theory
            look at the average runtime
        Consider probablitiy that divides are roughly even
            L approximately = R
            L = 1/4n    R=3/4N
        Uses fact: Expected value is linear
### Expected Value
    x-event     E-avaergae
    x - roll a fair dice
    E(x) = Sum(x)*probabiltiy(x)
        = 1 * 1/6 + 2 * 1/6 + 3 * 1/6 + 4 * 1/6 + 5 * 1/6 + 6 * 1/6
        = 3.5
    roll two dice
        E[x_1 + x_2] = E(x_1) + E(x_2)
            = 3.5 + 3.5 = 7
### Expected Runtime is O(nlogn)
    pretty good runtime, faster than merge sort
