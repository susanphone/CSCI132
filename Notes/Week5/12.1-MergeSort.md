# 12.1 - Merge  Sort
    Recall insertion sort
        {3   1   4   2}
        iterations  # of comparisions
        [3]                 0
        [1  3]              1
        [1  3   4]          2
        [1  2   3   4]      2
        Worst Case
        [1  2   3   4]
        iteration   # of comparisons
        [1]                 0
        [1  2]              1
        [1  2   3]          2
        [1  2   3   4]      3

        total comparisions:
            0+1+2+3+...+(n-1)+n
                = n(n+1)/2  = n^2/2 + n/2
                    O(n^2)
    Can we do better?
    faster runtime?
## Divide and Conquer
    Divide- divide inout into smaller pieces

    Conquer - recursively(call itself) solve sub problems

    Combine - take sub solutions and build a solution to the original
### Merge-Sort Example
    Good example in the  book
    [8  3   2   1   7   5   6   4]
        Divide in half
    [8  3   2   1]  [7  5   6   4]
        Array of length 1 or 0 is sorted
    [8  3]  [2   1] [7   5] [6   4]

    [8] [3] [2] [1] [7] [5] [6] [4]
        Combine 
            have two sorted arrays combine in O(n) time.
    [3  8]  [1  2]  [5  7]  [4  6]
        3 checks 1, 3 checks 2, at the end of the array the 3 and 8 join
        compare the first two, 4 < 5, compare the 5 and 6, 5 < 6, compare 6 to 7, 6 < 7
    [1  2   3   8]  [4  5   6   7]
        compare 1 and 4, compare 2 and 4, compare 3 and 4, compare 8 and 4.
        compare 8 and 5, compare 8 and 6, compare 8 and 7.
    [1  2   3   4   5   6   7   8]
### Runtime of Merge Sort
    What is the height of the tree
        n - length
        n/2^h < or = to 1       solve for h
        log(n) < or = to h
    Height is log(n)
    Merging is O(n) at each level ==> O(nlog(n)) runtime
### The Master Method(Theorem)
    gives runtime of divide and conquer algorithms
