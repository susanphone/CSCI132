# 7.1 Array Lists
    want to store items linearly (ordering)
    Arrays                                  Lists
        A = [1  2   3]                      1 -> 2 -> 3
        can access any index                access an index has to iterate
        O(1)                                O(n)
        Fixed size : (                      no fixed length :)
### What properties do we want?
    ADT = what methods?
        size()
        isEmpty()
    need try catch to ensure not accessing things outside the list for methods below
        get(i) - ith index
        set(i,e) - ith index is e   (update)
        add(i, e) - insert new thing
        remove(i)
