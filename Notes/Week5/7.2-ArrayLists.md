# 7.2 Array Lists
    unbounded array(vectors in C++)
    Base data structure is an array
        get(i)      set(i,e) ----------built in methods

        add(i, e) and remove(i) might require shift
            A = [1 2 3]
                A.add(1, 4)
                [1 2 3]
                = 1 4 2 3 
            O(n) for shifting
### Idea 1:
        make an array so big you will never fill it.
            uses too much memory :(
### Idea 2:
        start with a little extra room and add space as needed
    A = [1 2 3]
        add(1, 4)
    B = [1, 2, 3, null, null, null]
        Copy A and make B = [1 4 2 3 null null]
### Consider add an element
        Runtime: Double every power of 2
        Amortized Analysis (average runtime)
            Average height is 3
        Total runtime is 3n
        therefore updating is O(n)
